## What is Laravel-Spa
Laravel-Spa installs all necessary items for a fresh Laravel Single Page Application.

The installation uses next to laravel:
- Vue with Vue-Router as Javascript-Framework and routing
- Pinia as state store
- Vuetify as css-framework
- Sanctum as authentication-system for single-page-applications
- Vite for asset bundling

It provides:
- Login page together with a 'Unkown password' page and a Register page
- The login use a 2-factor-authentification (password an email), if the user has set 2-fa option

For the authenticated admins it supports
- Dashboard
- Users page, where all users are listed, may be added, changed or deleted
- Profile update with password change
- Logout

It integrates the Spatie roles and you can manage the role-based access to all web- and api-routes.

After installing this package, you can easily start to develop your own single page application with all necessary requirements.

composer require symfony/http-client
```


## Usage

## Permissions for routes ##
### Web-Routes ###
Under routes/meta/web there is for each route.js-file a php-file.
Here you may define, which routes need which (spatie-)roles.
if the array is empty, no permission is needed.

With a simple command you can synchronize these files.
The php-file is made actual with the route-js-file as basis:
```bash
    php artisan routes:sync
```

### Api-Routes ###
Under routes/meta/api there must exist a file for each api-route.
If you have following api-routes: 
/admin/config
/routes/check
You must have two files:
admin.php
routes.php

There you may define routes, which are protected with roles.


### Sending E-Mails ###
That everything works fine, sending E-Mails must be configured.
I use Postmark for Mailing and everything is fine.
You can find more infos under Laravel/Notifications
